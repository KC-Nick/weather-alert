# Weather Alert

## Description

With this app, I wanted to show what we've learned to apply an API to a web page where one could enter a city and find the weather for the next five days. I also have implemented a feature so that the search history is saved by local storage, and appears on the page in the form of a history list. Clicking on these search history list items will allow the page to show the city's weather again as if they had been searched.
